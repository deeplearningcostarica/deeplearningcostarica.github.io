# Costa Rica Deep Learning Retreat
Begin your deep learning journey steps away from the beach. Whether you have some basic deep learning knowledge or are curious about it and want to get your feet wet, this course is for you. You will teach you all the basics for applying deep learning to real world problems.  

It presents all the theory you need to start applying deep learning in practice and teaches you how to implement it using the latest tools and libraries (pytorch, tensorflow, GPUs, TPUs, etc.)  . By the end of this program, you should have enough basic knowledge to start implementing your own ideas.

## About the Location
Uvita, Costa Rica, bahia ballena (whale's tale)

## Teachers
The retreat is guided by deep learning experts with years of experience in both research and industry.

## Dates
The first edition will take place December 7th to 21st 2021.

## Tuition
* Earlybird registration (before September 1st): 2249 USD / person
* Regular registration: 2449 USD / person
