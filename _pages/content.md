The goal of the course is to indtroduce and apply all of the common building blocks in common deep learning applicatins.

It presents all the theory you needto start applying deep learning in practice and teaches you how to implement it using the latest tools and libraries (pytorch, tensorflow, GPUs, TPUs, etc.)  . By the end of this program, you should have enough basic knowledge to start implementing your own ideas.

The course is a mix of theory and hands-on practice in the form of coding assignments. 

## Topics Covered

* Python tools - library management, virtual environments, numpy, pandas, jupyter notebooks + colab 
* Machine learning concepts: classification, regression, gradient descent + backpropagation, clustering
* Deep learning Concepts - Multi Layer perceptrons, Convolutional Neural Networks, RNN/LSTM, Transformers, etc.
* Deep learning applications - Computer Vision, Natural Language Processing, Sound Processing, time-series forecasting
* Deep learning Libraries - Pytorch, tensorfow/keras
* Experiment Management tool/concepts - monitoring results, model selection, hyperparameter optimization
* Model deployment - Deploying and maintaning models, edge computing, scaling concepts
